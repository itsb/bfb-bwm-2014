This is the model associated with the paper:

Behabadi BF, Mel BW
Mechanisms underlying subunit independence in pyramidal neuron dendrites
PNAS. 2014;111(1)

The code here reproduces Figures 2b-e, 4b-e, and S5b-f from the paper.

Usage:
./runall.sh
# This will generate 42 h5 files and 44 pkl files in data/ and 3 png files in figs/

Dependencies:
NEURON 7.0 - 7.3
Python 2.5 - 2.7
Numpy 1.5.1 - 1.7.1
PyTables 2.1.2 - 2.4.0
Matplotlib 1.0.1 - 1.1.1

Notes: 
Figures 2 and S5 may not exactly match those in paper due to PRNG issues.
Will likely work with other versions of above dependencies with minor tweaks.
